# Tango-website

Tango homepage which was built using HTML, CSS and JS. You can find out more information on the different flavours offered by clicking on one of the can icons located 3/4 down the page, once clicked the showcase image changes to that flavour.

In future, I plan to add media queries to target mobile users and give them a more tailor and suitable interface to work with, as well as more pages to make it more complete. Eventually I may include Bootstrap to assis and make it more responsive.
