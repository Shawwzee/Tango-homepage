# Tango-website

Tango landing page which was built using HTML, CSS and JS. You can find out more information on the different flavours offered by clicking on one of the can icons located 3/4 down the page, once clicked the showcase image changes to that flavour. I also used Font Awesome for the social media icons seen in the footer.

In future, I plan to add media queries to target mobile users and give them a more tailor and suitable interface to work with, eventually I may include Bootstrap to assist with making the website more responsive.
